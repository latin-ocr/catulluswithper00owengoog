xiv
theory is based on a statement at the beginning of
S, Sunt uero versus xxii. But versus must mean not
stanzas, as he supposes, but lines, and the numeral is a
slip for xcii (Buecheler, p. 52, Nettleship in Journal
of Philology, 18. 142). Riese (Anthol. Lat. i. p. xxii)
thinks that xxii is a mistske for xvii, and that it is
meant that the Pervigilium is the poem (so he under-
stands versus) which stands seventeenth in the collec-

tion of the Anthologia. This explanation is scholarly‚
but I prefer the one which I have adopted.

1 have to thank ΜΓ. F. Haverfield, Student and
Tutor of Christ Church, for his kindness in reading
through the proof-sheets of my book.
