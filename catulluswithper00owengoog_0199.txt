have kept ln the text, there is an awkwnrd transition from the
concubinus to his rnaster.

152. cave ne ηερε, Possibly we should read ww daeneges:
cp⁴ ςι)4 19-

133. ni is read sor ne in V, but most MSS. have ne. lt is
certain that ni was another form οἵ ne, but, if nc is genuine in
15². 1 cannot, with most editors, believe that Catullus used two
disserent forms os the same word in successive lines. Also ne is
common ln Catullus, while ni can scarcely be said to he

158. ser-:tim Bcrn. Pisanus ; servit MSS.

171* intus Statius; unus MSS„ kept by Ellis; then unus
accubans means 'waiting alone sor you.¹

186. vos, omitted in MSS.y was added by Statius. 1 am‘

3. 4 73, quamvis longe ugione remotus absim ,- in my note on

and consequently his emendation snpra is unnecessaty. Thus
the meaning will be ‘lay out the maiden aright, ye matrons os
approved chastity' ; bonae being predicate. The usual explana-
tion ‘good mntrons known sor good' is tautologicall
