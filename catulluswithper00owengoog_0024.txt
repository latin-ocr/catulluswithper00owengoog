The Pervigilium Veneres is a charming poem in

. trochaic rhythm of unknown authorship and date. It

probably belongs to the third century of the Empire
(see Teuffel, 398. 6) : Baehrens has attributed it to ’

Tiberianus (Poetae Latini Minores, 4. 48). Itis pre-

(1) S=Salmasianus, aseventh century MS. in the

N ational Library at Paris, No. 1o,318. Ἴ

(2) T=Thuaneus‚ in the N ational Library at Paris,

No. 8071. This is the same ninth century MS. as

that which contains Catullus 62.
The collatioris of these two MSS. Ι have taken

from Baehrens. ln editing the Pervigiliom I have used
the Variorum notes in Valpy's Delphin Catullus, and
the editions of Wernsdorf (Poetae Latini Maitores,
3. 425 foll), Buecheler (Lips. 1859), and Baehrens
(Poetae Latini Minores, 4. 292). There is a paper
by Mr. Mackail in the Journal of Philology, 17. 179
foll. from which l have not been able to gain any·

in quatrains seems to me untenable, as introducing

worse confusion into an already difficolt text. The
