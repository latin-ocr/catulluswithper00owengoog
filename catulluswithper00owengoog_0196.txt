32. nostri sis is rightly retained by Ellis and Schmidt. Most
editors accept vostri sim. the conjecture os Parthenius.

Birt in a recently published pamphlet, De Amorum in arta
antiqua simulacris et de puerz's minutis apud antiquos in deliciis
habitis (Marburg, ¹892)· has suggested an entirely new interpre-
tation os this poem. He thinks that Camerius was a boy
favourite os Catullus, aptarim and that the point is that the child
is so securely hidden that his master (so Birt interprets xps-:dine 9)
cannot discover the place of his concealment, he is inclined to
understand libellis, line 4, literally ; the poet hunted sor the child
behind the books. He readssmnas in line 8: and in line 9 soll.
‘ Puellae' sic tpse flagitabam, ¹ eumerium milti, pessimae puellaer'
Quaedam inquit: ‘nudum reduc [et auser] Hem—hic in roseis
latet papae'lltsr' In line 26 Ede Audacter, committe crede lum· :
‘Ale unctae lacteolaae tenent puellae! In line 32 Dum vestri
sim particeps amans. The pamphlet is well illustrated from
antiques, and sull of recondite learning, characteristic os the
author os Das antike Buchwesen ,- but the conelusions in
this instance seem to me sanciful. Birt does not consider that
lines 14-23 sorrn part os this poem, but would leave them where
they stand in the MSS. as a separate· effusion addressed to
Cameriusr ¹ Prius nempe poema cottidiana loquela utitur,
posterius rhetoricum est ; alterum in argumento simpliciter
enarrando decurrit, alterum magno apparatu fabulari ornatum et
oneratum est Perseo, Rheso similibus in comparationem vocatis.'
Birt, p. vii: but the mock-heroic trifling adds an additional
zest to this cherming poem.
