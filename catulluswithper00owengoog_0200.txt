196-200 stand after 205 in the MSS. and were restored to

their proper place by Scaliger, who also brilliantly corrected
196 in which the MSS. have ad maritum tamen iuuenem.

204. cupis cupis V; cupis capis the other MSS. and the second
hand of G: this is retained by Ellis.

206. Africi Heinsius; em'cei V.

220. semlemnte L. M'uller ; sed milei (milei) ante MSS. See L.
Mulier, De re metrica, p. 260, Brambach‚ Heilssbie'clelein seir
lateinz'sclze Rechtsclzreibung, p. 60.

224. sic Hermann; et MSS. Some change is necessary as
synaphea is constant in the poem: see Munro‚ pp. 138-139.

LXll.

8. certe est Statius; certe si V.

14 This line is found only in the Thuanean Anthology (T)
at Paris ; it occurs in none os the other MSS. (Ellis).

17. convertite T ; committite V.

20. quis T; qui V. Here quis is certainly right, and T shows its
excellence in alone preserving it. Besides the fact that qui in
two different senses in consecutive lines is at least remarkable,
it should be noticed that quis with the word deus in agreement
with it occurs 40. 3 3 61.46; 66. 31 ; add 107. 7. Cp. Stat. Theb.
12. 443, vicit nempe Creon! nusquam mm regna, quis ardor?
where qm' ardor could not have been written. lt is strange that

Baehrens alone should have adopted quis.

26. quis T ; qui V and all editors except Baehrens.
