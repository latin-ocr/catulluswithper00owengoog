XVI.

12. quod is the reading of some inferior MSS.; que V; qui
(quei) Ellis from a few MSS. With qui I think a subjunctive
would have been required. There is little to be said for quom,
L. Mtiller.

XVII.

3. arulis (from axula, a diminutive os axis) is the emendation
of Schwabe for ac sulcis MSS. Perhaps Catullus wrote axiclis
:axiculzh from axz'culus,· at any rate there is more evidence for
the existence of this word. ¹

Between this poem and XXI. the early editors inserted
without any manuscript authority three poems dealing with
Priapus: XVIII, the fragment No. 2 in this edition
beginning Hunc lucum ,· XIX, Priapea No, iii. of the Appendix
Vergiliana beginning Huncego, 0 iuvenem XX, Priapea No, ii.
in the Appendix Vergiliana beginning Ego llaec, ego arte. See
Baehrens, Poetae Latini Minores, ii. p. 158 3 Ribbeck, Appendix
Vergiliana, p. 147.

XXI.

11. me me puer MSS.; Mellitus Hand, followed by Ellis.
Scaliger’s a! me me, accepted by Mliller, is palaeographically
tempting; but the repetition os me is tame. Faernus, with
some probability, conjectured, vae ! meur.

XXII.

5. palimpsestos Baehrens; palmisepto V. In lines 6-7,
with Schmidt, I follow Munro.
