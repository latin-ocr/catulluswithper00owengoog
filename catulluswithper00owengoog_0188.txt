there), everywhere else he uses the singular form. Cicero once
has the plural lorm, De prov. cans. ξ 3, Galliae duae, quas iioc
tempore uno imperio videmus esse coniunctas ,· but there duae
makes the difference. In Livy we find, 21. 21 §10‚dnm ipse
terrestri per Hispaniam Galliasque itinere Italiam peteret, and
ibid. 23 §Q qnae Hispanias Galliis iungant, both passages it is
true relating to the time os the second Punic war; but then
Livy lived later than Catullus. ln writers of the Empire the
plural is frequent and official, as in Tacitus, Pliny's Natural
History, and Suetonius, ag. Yib. 41, Calig. 47, Ner. 43.

Therefore l am inclined to think that the e at the ¹end ol
Galliae came lrom the i at the beginning os the next word
(dittography). The next step in the corruption was that
Britanniae was written for Britannia, in order to assimilate it
to this erroneous Galliae- the later use os the plural, a's in
Plin. N.H. 17. 43, illam Gallias Britanniasqiielocupletantem, may
have assisted in producing the mistake. Further timete! was
written lor it timet,· transposition os words is one of the
commonest mistakes in MSS.; cp. 61. 46; 63. 49: see my
Tristia prolegg. pp. xxxviii. and xlvi, andagood collection from
Horace in a paper by Mi. Housman in the Journal asPliilology,
18, p. 6. Lastly, that lianc is corrupt is obvious; ‘it is certain
that Catullus would not have allowed this word to be repeated
in two consecutive lines' (Ellis, Camm. p. 104).

These are the reasons which have led me to make the emen·
dation which l have ventured to print in the text. Munro
conjectures et liai'cne Gallia et mitet Britannia? accepted by
Schmidt with the alteration of nictit for metit. Postgate reads
eine Galliae ultima et Britanniae?
