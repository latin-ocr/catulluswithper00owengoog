is clear from the Dc'gest 13. 6. 18 §2 (a discussion of commo·
datium), possunt iustae causae intervenire, exquibus cnm eo qui
commodasset agi deberet : veluti de impensis in ualetudinem serui
factis . . . uam cibariorum impensae naturali scilicet ratione ad
eum pertinent, qui utendum accepisset. lt is agreed that commode}
cannot be imperative. Schmidt follows Hand in reading istos .·
commodum enim valo ad Sarapim. Postgate (see Journal os
Philologu, 17. 229) prints istos: commodum enim : uolo ad
Sarapim, which to my ear is too abrupt.

27. For mane the MSS. have mane me, on which Munro
remarks, ‘mant‘ me is surely not admissible in Catullus, nor do

the words appear to have any satisfactory meaning.' Guarinus
and other Italian scholars corrected the line by omitting me,-

and this is surely right ; meis an error due to dittography. For
cecant inquii cp. 57. 7, lectulo erudituli. It is not however fair to
produce Ov. Trist. 1. 8. 31, valedicere, as a parallel, for (1) dicere
does not begin witha vowel and (2) the reading is no doubt
wrong, and vel dicere must have been what Ovid wrote, as 1 have

shown in my note. Of emendations of mane me Pontanus'
minime is most attractive.

32. pararc'm MSS. is rightly retained by Ellis and Schwabe.
lt is strange how inveterate is the schoolboy's favourite
delusion that a conditional clause in Latin requires to be intro·
duced by si. lt is unnecessary here to say that quam=quam
si ,· still more unnecessary to add that of this there seems to
be no other elcample. ‘ff I have bought them for myself'
can be expressed equally well in Latin by milei pararim or si
neila paratim: as can be seen by referring to Roby's Latin

Grammar,§ 1552. Thus paratis, the conjecture of Statius,
accepted by Postgate, is superfluous.
