23. rrratrurrr Schol. Veron. on Verg. Aen. 5. 80; mater MSS.
The same scholiast has preserved the following line in a trun·
cated form (progenies salvete iter), which is omitted in the MSS.
of Catullus. 1 have adopted Munro’s supplement iterumque
iterumque horterum.

29. te Nerine is my conjecture ; nectine V, which is unmetrical ;
Nereine Haupt and most editors, The form Nerine occurs in
Verg. Ee. 7. 37. The repetition of te points an emphatic eontrast
to Nerine, the contrast of a mortal with a goddess a contrast
which has been beautifully developed in Tennyson's Tithonus.
So in Hom. Od. 6. 76 sor the awkward σὲ ’γὰρ eard πολλὰ
μογήσας ἐς πρώτην ἱκόμην Ι propose to transpose the letters oi
ἐς and read σὲ πρώτην ἱκόμην, For the emphatic repetition
oi te and σὲ cp. Verg. Aen. 9. 427, me me, ericum qui feci, in
rue conterrite ferrum ,· Aen. 8. 144, me me ipse uerumque obr'eci
caput,· 12. 210, me, me diue serrum corripite,· Cic. p. Sest.§ 121.

32. cui Ι have printed, L. M'riller has already conjectured quoi.
The MSS. have que (percu), a mistake for qui, as cui was osten
written, eg. supra 1. 1 appears in many MSS. qui dono, etc.
Quae is too indefinite to be right as no days have been men·
tioned before.

optato V; fluite O (finito the other MSS. ), whence Ellis reads
optritofiuitue renueremus, ‘the days determined by the eoveted
hour,' which may be right, but seems to me rather artificial.
On the other hand, terminations in MSS. are osten confused.
Optatae finito is the reading of most editors and some MSS.

36. Cieros Meineke3 siros V.

56. seseque sui tui se credit V, which was corrected by Voss
