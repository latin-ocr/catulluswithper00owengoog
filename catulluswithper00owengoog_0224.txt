10. fugiant Avantius; fugiunt MSS. It is impossible to
retain the indicative in a dependent question introduced by cur,·
it is strange that Lachmann, Schwabe, Schmidt, Ellis, Baehrens,
and Postgate should all keep fugiunt ,· but Heinsius and Munro
decide sor fugiunt. The evidence produced to support fugiunt is
a collection of passages by no means parallel, taken srorn Holtze
2. 236 and Draeger 1. 461. All these pasages are to be ex·
plained on quite a different principle, the principle of parataxis:
poetry and colloquial prose love to employ co-ordinate rather
than subordinate clauses. Thus Plaut. Rud. 948, eloquere quid id
est? means ‘speak out; what is it?’ and should be printed
eloquere: quid idest? Of course quid id est is not equivalent
to quid id sit. cist. 1. 1. 55, quid, cede, te, obsecro, tum abhorret
hilaritudo? means ‘Why, please, l beg you, do you object so
much to cheerfulnessi' Quid abhorret does not depend on
obsecro, which rather, like cedo, is parenthetical. Pers. 215, erge
leoc rui expedi, quo agis te P is two clauses, ‘Come now, explain
this to me: where are you off toi' Capt. 983, quid erat et
nornen? si uera dicis, memorandum milii: is obviously three
clauses, ‘What was his name? if you speak the truth, you must
tell me' On the same principle must be explained Verg. Ec. 4
52, aspice ! uenturo laetantur ut omniu saeclo, where laetentur would
have been written in prose. There are two clauses: ‘See l how
everything rejoices’ Geor. 1. 56, noune vides P croceos ut Tmolus
odores, India mittit ebur! (sothe passage should be stopped).
Aen. 6. 779, uiden P ut geuu'nae stant uertice crestae! 855, aspice,
ut ingreditur! So Plaut. Trin. 60, saxo haud tantillum dederis
verborum milei, ‘ Ι warrant you shall not cheat me the least bit
