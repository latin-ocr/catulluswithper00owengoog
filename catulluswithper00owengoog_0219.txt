47—48. The meaning is ‘he is a tall man, who was once
involved in a long law-suit through the pretended pregnancy os
a deceptive wornb.’ The elue to the litigation is l believe to be
found in Dignst 25. 6. 1, si de possessione ventris nomine quaeratur
el alserente lnrede nndier iuraverit praegnantem se esse, servandum
est ins iurandum nee tenebitur multer, quasi calumniae causa
feurit in pnseninnn internuntiis eisaer'endaest portius iuran-

longus leinno as his next of kin would as leores have entered into
possessiones the successim, unless the widow gave birth to a
son. (The will would ol course be invalid by the birth οῖ’ a
posthumous son, Cic. De Or. 1 ξ 241 ; p. Caec. §72.) But she
swore salsely that she was pregnant, and so was mena in
possessionem. Subsequently the longus horno had to bring an
action to dispossess her, ascenderatis petitio. Mr. E. A. Whittuck
has lrindly lavoured nie with the followIng note :—‘ The only
point requiring explanation is as to the reason of the law-suit
being a long one. The following may be the explanation. The
wornan is put into possession by the Praetor and can claim
rnaintenance lrurn the property os which she is in possession.
No child is born, and os course she must give up the property to
the heir, having no defenee against nerediran's petitio. Is she
boreo fide believed she was with child, she would not have to pay
boel< what she had talren irorn the property sor her maintenance,
but is ns in the present case she fraudulently pretended herself
to be with child, the heir could clairn to be indemnified on
account ol the loss to the inheritance arising from her fraud.
