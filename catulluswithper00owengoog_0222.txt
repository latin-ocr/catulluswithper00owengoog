101. simul, omitted in the MSS, was added by the Italian
scholars. Palmer conjectures fertur vi vindice pubes (Class. Rev.

5. 8).

102. lt is unnecessary with Miiller, followed by Postgate, to
write Graia for Graeca. Graius is perhaps more usual in poets,
but Graecus is the only form known to Lucilius, and to Ovid in
the Tristia. Propertius uses Graecus: Horace has it twice in
the Odes and often in the Epistles and Ars Poetica. Persius
Juvenal and Martial use both Graecus and Graius. Tibullus
uses neither. Vergil, Statius, and Silius use Graius.

118. tandem indomitum is my emendation of tuum domitum
V. Translate: ‘But deeper than that mere was your deep
love, Laodamia, which taught at last your untamed husband to
bear the yoke.' Schwabe, following Corradino de Allio, reads
tunc indomitam ,· Munro, Schmidt, and Postgate adopt Heyse's
tamen indomitam. To both these readings l object that there

ι is no point in calling Laodamia indomita ,· and that the MSS.
indicate a masculine termination. The meaning, I take it, is
that so strong was the passion of Laodamia for Protesilaus that
she drew him to love her, she was the aggressor in the conflict
of affection, she won the hard soldier to love; cp. 129. I
cannot believe with Ellis that the poet wrote dominum domitum .·
sound is against it.
