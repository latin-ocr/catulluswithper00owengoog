lumine an Italian conjecture lor numine V ; cp. supr. 7. Ellis
adopts liuu'ue from three inferior MSS.

63. uvidulam Bapt. Guarinus; uimiulum V. Ellis conjectures
umidulam.

stetu Palladius ; fluctu V and apparently the other MSS, which
is retained by Ellis, but can hardly be explained.

66. iuncta Lycaoniae Parthenius ; iuxta licaonia V.
70. restituit Lachmann ; restituem V.

71. lroe is my conjecture; lere MSS. Hic fari would mean ‘to
talk on this occasion,’ an expression which is hardly felicitous.

74. aeri an Italian correction: uere V, is retained by Nigra;
but the adverb seems out os place.

78. Ι have reconstructed this passage (Classical Reoiew, 4·
312) by accepting unguentorum lrom the late Paris MS. 8236
(Rossbach, p. vii): omnibus expers I take to mean ‘lree srom
lover3,’ cp. Plaut. Pseud. 1. 5. 83, amores expers ,· Hor. Carm. 3. 11.
11, nuptiarum expers ,· Ov. M. 1. 478, illa aversata petentes,
impatiens expersque uiri, nemora avia lustrat, nec quid Hymen,
quid Amor, quid siut conubia curat,· Stat. Tmo. 10. 62, expers
conubii. The construction os an ablative with expers, instead os
the ordinary genitive, belongs to the older Latin, and is sound in
Plautus, Terence, Turpilius, and Sallust: see Klihner, 2. 477 and
485. The MSS. have omnibus expers unguentis, which is
retained by Ellis, Schwabe, and Schmidt.

79. cum Corradino de Allio (quam Haupt) ; quem V.
