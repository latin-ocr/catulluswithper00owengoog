the wealth oi imperial Rome. The MSS. have urite pulen-
tissime. Schmidt reads urbis o putissimi, Postgate urbii o
piissimi, modisying Lachmann's urbis opit‘ssime. Perhaps we
should read urbis editissimae, ie. domina Roma, which opulen-
tissimae may have been a gloss intended to indicate. Prop. 3.

¹3· Here the MSS. have gaudete vos quoque Lydiae (littra)
lactis undae,· this was early corrected by the Italian scholare
into gandete vosque Lydiae, on which Lachmann improved by
writing gaudete vosque 0 Lydiae. (Postgate's note is incorrect.)
This is accepted by Ellis and Schwabe3 but (1) it iails to
explain the qunque of the MSS„ and (2) in this simple poem,
lull oi passionate love ior the poet’s Italian home, the epithet
Lydian is strangely unfortunate, and l cannot believe that
Catullus wrote what requires a note full oi recondite learning

to maire it intelligible. The liquidae of Postgate and limpidae
ol Avantius are better, but both necessitate our reading vosque.
Therclore l conjecture gaudete vos quoque Italae lacus undae.
The epithct Italae is transferred from lanes to undae in a
manner not unlike Catullus 3 see above on 6. 10. Return to his
home, to the Italy that he loves, is the keynote oi the poem ;
thus the epithet Italae is quite appropriate. Cp. Verg. Aen. 3.
