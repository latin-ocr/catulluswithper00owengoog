out in writing my notes Doering’s edition (Lipsiae
1788), Lachmann's (Berlin 1861), Schwabe’s two
editions (Gissae 1866, Berolini 1886), and his Ques-
tiones Catullianae (Gissae 1862); Ellis’s text (and

edition 1878) and Commentary (and edition 1889),
Schmidt's edition (Lipsiae 1887), whose Prelegomena

are valuable, and that of Postgate (London 1889).
Besides these I have used Rossbach (Lipsiae 1863),
L. Muller (Lipsiae 1874), Baehrens's critical edi-
tion and Commentary (Lips. 1876-1885) and the
excellent special edition of the Coma Berenices by
Constantino Nigra (Milan 1891), whose commentary,
written in Italian, is exhaustive. There is an in- s
teresting essay on Catullus in Nettleship's Essays,
p. 84. Mr. Grant Allen has recently published a
spirited translation of ‘the Attis into English verse:
London, Nutt, 1892. He has added an essay on the
Galliambic mette, of which it is difficult to spealr.
By treating this simple metre as ‘an iarnbic·anapaestic
rhythm,’ he has, to my ear, rendered it impossible to
scan the poem. Mr. Allen has dealt with the metre

. as if it were modern and not ancient verse.
