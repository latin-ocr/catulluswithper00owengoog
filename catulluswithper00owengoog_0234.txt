NOTES

TO Tun

PERVIGILIUM VENERIS.

2. vere natus orbis est Pithoeus; the poets thought that the
birthtime ol the world was in spring. uer natus orbis est‘s ;
rcere natus tbuis est S, from which Buecheler reads uere natus est
Ionas (nom). But ι’ωιίε is probably a mere corruption os orbis ‚-
and there is something out ol keeping with the rest os the poem
in the mention oi Jupiter. Few will approve ol' either
Wernsdorl's ver renatus orbis est, ‘spring is the new birth of
the world,' which is hardly Latin, or os Baehrens’ ver renactus
orbis est.

9. Unnecessary difficulties have been raised about the
meaning os tunc. lt is true that we have to go back to ver in
line 2, ‘in spring Venus was born ol sea soam,' but l sceno
awkwardness in this ; the burden oi the poem is spring, the poet's
mind is lull os spring, and he can safely trust the intelligent
reader to interpret tunc correctly. lt will be seen that Ι cannot
agree either with Buecheler who inserts lines 59—61 between
lines 8 and 9 here, or with Riese and Baehrens who transpose

line 9 soll. to follow 62, or with Mackail (Journal okailology, 17.
