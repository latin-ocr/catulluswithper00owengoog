Doris MSS. seems to be right. 1t means dances in which the
dancers dressed like Spartan girls. ‘They seem to have worn a
light tunic, cut open at the skins, so as to leave the limbs
both free and exposed to view’ (Grote, History os Greece,
Part 2, ch. 6, Vol. 2, p. 303). Cp. Iuv. 3. 94, cum uxorem
comoedus ogit uel Dorida nullo nultum palliolo. Athenaeus
13. 589 F, Μέλισσαν ἰδόντα πελοπνννησιακῶς ἠσθημένην, ἀναμ-
πέχονος γὰρ καὶ μονοχίτων ἦν. lt has occurred to me that it
any change is required (none oi the existing conjectures is satis·
iactory) we might read novis ‘sprightly,’ a word ot'ten corrupted
in MSS„ eg. Ov. Trist. 5. 3. 373 ex P. 1. 10.12. The word is
applied to a thing, not a person, in Sil. ltal. 1. 549, naua rudi·
mento (where there seems to be some variant, though 1 cannot
understand the apparatus criticus os Bauer).

310. roseae niveo Guarinus ; roseo niuee V.

3²1· punientes is my conjecture ; pellentes V: though this may
be right, it is certainly unusua13 while the word Ι have
introduced seems to be specially appropriate to spinning: cp.
Ov. M. 6. 55, tela iugo iuncta est, stamen secernit hunaudo,
inseritur uzedium radiis subtemen acutt‘s, quod digiti opediunt,
atque iuter stamina ductum percusso paviunt insecti pectine dentes
‘ The warp is fastened to the cross-beam‚a reed separates the
thread, the west is woven in between it with sharp needles,
as it is unrolled by the fingers, and passed between the
threads is struck by the notched teeth of the rattiing
comb.' Cp. Seneca, Ep. Mor. 14 2, ξ 20.

345. campi an Italian conjecture sor the unmeaning tenen or
teuen oi MSS. Ι have suggested Pkeygtoe Teucro manabit
saerguine tellus (Classical Rev. 4 313).
