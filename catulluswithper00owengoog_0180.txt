24. novissimo is an ltalian correction for nouissime MSS.

6. Possibly dormiunda should be read, which would add to
the effective alliteration.

ιο. quassu is not corrupt, as has been suspected, but is an in·
stance of the transference of an adjective from its proper substan·

tive (lectt) to another: so 7. 5, oraclum Iouis c‘utcraestucsi (where
aestuosi‘sultry’ belongs properly to oraclum). See Forbiger's

note on Aen. 1. 4; and inf. 31. 13. Verg. Aen. 2. 713, templum·
que vetustum desertae Cererir.

12. l have in this line mainly followed Schmidt, who how·
ever reads niuil vales. The MSS. have nam in (orm) ista
preualet nichil tacere, whence Haupt extracted nam nil stupra
valet, nilu'l, tacere. Schmidt has given good reasons for his
change; amongst other things he urges that stupra is too
abusive a word for Catullus to have applied to his friend's case.
l may also add that if the lady in question was a scortum (l. 5),
the word stuprum would be inappropriate; see Justiniandnstitt.
