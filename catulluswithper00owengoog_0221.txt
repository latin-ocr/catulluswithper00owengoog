7 5. r'nccptom Turnebus ς incepta V ; incepto Froehlich.

85. abesse is the reading of a few MSS„ which I adopt with
lllunro in preference to abisse V. As regards abesse it is true
that the rhetorical use of the perfect referring to the future
is not uncommon, as in the examples quoted by Ellis; but non

longo ternpore is equivalent to atrox, and this seems to make all
the difference. Vou could say z'am vici= vincam, ‘l have already
as good as conquered‘; but non longo tempore vici or mox vici
would be hardly possible.

91. quaeque itidem is my emendation of the corrupt que vetet
id of V. Itidem, a word of the older Latin, is found in Plautus
and in Lucr. 3. 12. The meaning is,‘And it too has brought
piteous death in lilre manner to my brother.¹ Catullus has item
61. 36. lllost editors adopt quaene etiam, the conjecture of
Heinsius, to which Ellis fairly objects that it is improbable that ’
Catullus would have used this conversational formula in an
elaborately constructed poem based on a Greek model.
