that reveals the supreme misery of the despairing
lover. As a poet of the affections Catullus rises
to a higher pinnacle than was ever reached by the
light-hearted and frigid Horace.

The text of Catullus depends mainly upon two
manuscripts :

(ι) Ο, the Oxford MS. Canonici 30, written
about the year 1400, which is the best. This MS.
has been collated by Ellis, Baehrens, and Schwabe : I

have examined it myself in some passages.

(2) G, the Sangermanensis,a MS. of St. Germain-
des-Pres, preserved in the N ational Library at Paris
(No. 14,137). The MS. was finished on October
19, 1375, according to a note of the scribe. lt has
been collated by Sillig, Rossbach, Baehrens, Dtibner,
Max Bonnet, and Ellis; and a photographic faesimile
of the whole MS. has been published by M. Emile
Chatelain (Paris, Leroux, 1890), which 1 have found
most useful in preparing this edition.

There existed at Verona in the tenth century a
manuscript'of Catullus, now lost, which was referred

to in ΑΛ). 975 by Ratherius, Bishop of Verona
