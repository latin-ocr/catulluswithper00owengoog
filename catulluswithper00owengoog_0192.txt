XLVIII.

The following translation os this poem by Μῐ, J. S. Phillimore,
Scholar os Christ Church, seems worthy of preservation :—

Dem- love, if it were mine
To kiss sor evermore
With kisses millionsoffl

Those honeyed lips os thine;

Ι should not have my fi11;
Although the harvest storn:
Os kisses were untold

As the dry cornstalks, still

1 should not have my fill.

ὥς σε γὰρ ἴδω, βραχέως· με φόνος
