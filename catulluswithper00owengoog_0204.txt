¹4 seri MSS.; freti Schrader and most editors. Here emersere
is 1 think intransitive, and voltus nom., as Ellis takes it against
Munro. Silius seems to have 'understood the line in this way 7,
413, cum trepidae fremitu vitreis e sedibus antri aequoreae
pelago simul emersere sorores. Then Nereides is in apposition.

16⁷ 0 has illa alia videre luoe marinas; G and most MSS. illa
alque alia videre luce marinas. The reading os the Datanus and
a few MSS. οἵ no authority, viderunt, has been accepted by most
editors insteadps videre. But why should most MSS„ and the best,
give the unmetrical videre for m'dcrunt? How did the alteration
come about? Again, most editors, accepting atque as genuine,
which word is omitted in 0, give us the following highly prosaie
line, illa, atque haud alia, viderunt luce marinas. l believe that
atque os most MSS. is a clumsy insertion intended to patch up
a line that was deficient through something having slipped out
in the Verona archetype. 1 have already suggested illa haud
multa alia (Classical Rcview. 4. 3¹2) : but 1 now think that
videre must be genuine ς cp. 62. 28 ; and that the poet wrote illa
alia videre nec ulla luce marinas, taking 0 here as the purest
source. Alia is misplaced in the order, to show that the stress is
on that word ι the event has happened never again. Nec ullus sor
nullus is quite a mannetism with Catullus : infi 233,haaec vigeant
